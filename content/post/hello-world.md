Welcome to my very first post!

This is my grand experiment, sure to be a rousing success, or epic failure. Whatever the case, I'm glad you're joining the journey with me.

The past year and the pandemic have given me pause and time to reflect on life and pursuits that truly matter to me. I wanted a space to share not only what I've learned in the past about myself - my interests and the skills I use every day, both personally and professionally - but new things I'm picking up as well and sharing that discovery process with you. Hopefully, we can all learn and teach together: where I succeed at something new, maybe you'll learn a thing or two yourself. If I fail miserably, you might have the expertise to help.

Either way, I hope you enjoy what you read and see here. I'll try to post and share as much as possible with you. Let me know what you like or want to see more of: get all up in my [DMs](https://twitter.com/mattmcelhannon), interact with me, and maybe teach me a thing or two. You can find out more about me [here]({{< ref "/about" >}}) and check out my socials in the sidebar to see what's going on in all areas of my life.

Will it be loads of fun or just a huge dumpster fire? Who cares! Let's do this thang!

Hello! I'm Matt. Nice to meet you. I'm an award-winning [Writer/Producer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattmcelhannon/) living in Burbank, CA with my black lab mix [Maggie](https://www.instagram.com/maggiemcelhannon/).

I've [worked](https://mcelhannon.tv/) in promotion, branding, and marketing for over twenty years with extensive experience in conceiving, writing, and producing short and long form content for on-air, print, and digital. I've written for talking animals and talking humans, and I especially love writing copy that makes people laugh - Janice at the post office just howls!

I specialize in entertainment for all ages. I was born and raised in the small college town of Athens, GA, and I draw a lot from my familyâ€™s down-home humor, giving my personal brand of marketing a unique, fun, and edgy perspective. I do my best to be clever and find the wit in every sound bite or frame of visual.

I've received several Promax Awards, a few Tellys, no Emmys or Peabodys yet, but I earned a degree from the [school](https://grady.uga.edu/) that hands those out.

I'd love to work on some great projects with you. [Reach out](mailto:matt@mattmcelhannon.com) and let's start a chat. Until then, I owe Janice some new material.
